My name is Samuel John. I am a DevOps engineer in the making, with past experiences in [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) administration, Cloud computing [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), a little bit of Open source and now [IaC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code), [PaaS](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/paas), [Docker](https://docker-curriculum.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), etc etc...

I invite you to join me on my journey into DevOps. I hope to frequently document my adventure here and share my past and new experiences as I journey along.
